## Example Summary
This is an update of TI AppNote SLAA208 for the MSPM0 series. It provides a simple interface to read and write an I2C EEPROM, such as the AT24C256.

The function signatures are (almost) the same as those in SLAA208. The only visible difference from the AppNote is that InitI2C requires an additional argument: a (configured) I2C device (I2C_Regs *)
to communicate with the EEPROM. sysconfig can provide this; it will be named something similar to "I2C_1_INST".

No error checking is performed, since SLAA208 did not provide for this.

The code relies on DriverLib, but not sysconfig.

Polling  (busy-waiting) is used rather than interrupts. This is because only sysconfig knows the ISR name.

### Device Migration Recommendations
This project was developed for a superset device included in the LP_MSPM0G3507 LaunchPad. Please
visit the [CCS User's Guide](https://software-dl.ti.com/msp430/esd/MSPM0-SDK/latest/docs/english/tools/ccs_ide_guide/doc_guide/doc_guide-srcs/ccs_ide_guide.html#sysconfig-project-migration)
for information about migrating to other MSPM0 devices.

### Low-Power Recommendations
SysConfig allows developers to easily configure unused pins by selecting **Board**â†’**Configure Unused Pins**.

For more information about jumper configuration to achieve low-power using the
MSPM0 LaunchPad, please visit the [LP-MSPM0G3507 User's Guide](https://www.ti.com/lit/slau873).

## Example Usage

Connect SDA and SCL between I2C Controller and the EEPROM. /WP should be tied High.
Note that I2C requires pull-up resistors. Internal pull-ups can be enabled in
SysConfig (see datasheet for resistance specification), but external pull-ups
might be required based on I2C speed and capacitance. External pull-ups can be
connected or enabled using the LaunchPad.
Compile, load and run the example.
LED2 will toggle periodically if transmission and reception were successful.
LED2 will remain off if there is a problem during initialization.
LED2 will remain on if there is a problem during data transfers.
USER_TEST_PIN GPIO will mimic the behavior of the LED pin on the BoosterPack
header and can be used to verify the LED behavior.
